# Frontend Mentor - News homepage solution

This is a solution to the [News homepage challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/news-homepage-H6SWTa1MFl). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 



## Overview
Completed the News homepage using React, Tailwind CSS and using the React-Burger-Menu library.

I used Grid to layout the page and flexbox for the children elements. This page was created using a mobile first approach.

The navbar menu changes based on the screen size, so you will have burger menu in mobile and the standard nav bar menu on desktop.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
